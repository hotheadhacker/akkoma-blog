Open-source is becoming a buzzword trap.<br /><br />Take VS Code — open source in repo, but the binaries you download? Full of telemetry. Not open at all.<br /><br />Then there’s Postiz — “self-hostable” social scheduling tool. The FOSS version is barely usable. It pushes you hard to upgrade… to something more expensive than closed-source rivals. And now they’re flirting with crypto tokens?<br /><br />Even AppFlowy, marketed as a Notion alternative, barely delivers.<br /><br />Being open-source shouldn’t mean bait-and-switch.<br /><br /><a href="https://social.isalman.dev/tag/oplog">#OpLog</a> — Day 2

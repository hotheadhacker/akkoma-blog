Stop Obsessing Over Scalability Before You Have a Product<br /><br />One of the strangest trends I’ve seen in the DevOps and startup world lately is how early teams rush to architect their projects for massive scale — before they’ve even validated their core product. Everyone seems obsessed with building for “millions of users” from day one, yet most of these products don’t survive long enough to reach even 100.<br /><br />I’ve been in DevOps for over four years now, and here’s what I’ve learned:<br />Everything is scalable.<br />Given the time, resources, and intent, any system can scale. Sure, some require more engineering effort, but it’s doable — it always is. But what’s not as easily fixable is a poorly thought-out product, a missing market fit, or a startup that ran out of steam because it spent all its energy on infrastructure gymnastics instead of value creation.<br /><br />I’ve seen so many projects set up from day one with:<br />	•	Microservices (without needing services in the first place),<br />	•	Kubernetes clusters (when they barely need one server),<br />	•	Kafka queues,<br />	•	Redis clusters,<br />	•	Full-blown observability stacks like Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, the whole suite,<br />	•	And CI/CD pipelines with dozens of automated checks and staged deployments.<br /><br />Meanwhile… their product isn’t even live. Or worse — it’s live, but no one’s using it.<br /><br />Scalability has become a vanity metric in the builder’s mind. Something to show off. Something to prove that they’re serious about tech. But it’s like building a ten-lane highway in the desert. Where are the cars?<br /><br />Why are we doing this?<br /><br />Because we’re letting fear and future-hypotheticals override logic:<br />	•	“What if we blow up overnight?”<br />	•	“What if TechCrunch features us tomorrow?”<br />	•	“What if 10,000 people sign up in the first week?”<br /><br />None of that matters if your product can’t keep even one person engaged.<br /><br />Here’s the honest truth:<br /><br />You can scale almost anything when needed — but you can’t inject product-market fit after you’ve exhausted your budget and energy on premature infra scaling.<br /><br />What’s the better approach?<br />	•	Build a solid, minimal product.<br />	•	Get it working on a basic setup. A single server, even.<br />	•	Keep your code readable and modular. That’s your best “scalability plan” right there.<br />	•	Maintain a rough SOP or checklist for scaling later. Know how you would scale when needed — but don’t build it yet.<br />	•	Track real usage. Then decide when to scale based on demand, not on your architecture fantasy.<br /><br />And I get it — it feels good to build fancy infra. It makes you feel like a real engineer. But building the right thing, with the right focus, is even harder — and that’s what separates successful products from the graveyard of over-engineered ghosts.<br /><br />So stop chasing scale before you’ve solved a problem.<br />Build value first. Scale later.<br /><br />⸻<br /><a href="https://social.isalman.dev/tag/oplog">#OpLog</a> - Day 4

A well-crafted README &gt; any fancy landing page.  <br /><br />Markdown is the new minimal web — clean, structured, and privacy-friendly.  <br /><br />GitHub READMEs (even profile READMEs) serve as reliable, fast-loading, no-tracking intros to your work.  <br />No scripts, no trackers, no third-party callouts leaking your IP.  <br /><br />You get formatting, links, badges, and even basic analytics — without writing a line of frontend.  <br /><br />Whether for personal or company branding, don't underestimate a good README.  <br />It's trustable, portable, and just works.<br /><br />---<br /><br /><a href="https://social.isalman.dev/tag/oplog">#OpLog</a> -Day3
